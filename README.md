#Ride Sharing - Pyber


Using a Hypothetical ride sharing company dataset, We analyze average fare and total number of rides by customers, as well total rides occurence in Urban, Suburban, and Rural communities.  We created bubble plot, and pie charts to visualize the data.

When we look at each cities, we saw that most the urban cities has lower total number of rides while greater average Fare.  Suburban cities has average total number of rides and average fares.  Rural cities has highly varied total number of rides while lowest average fare.


However when we look at combine data in each of the urban, suburban and rural communities. We saw that Urban spend most money on rides, most total rides happening , as well as most amount of driver. Suburban in middle, and rural spend less amount of money on rides, less total rides occurence and least number of driver. 

Which is not suprising because usually urban cities uses most ride sharing service, and suburban in between while Rural the places are far away so everyone drive on their own.  However, when we look at individual cities the trend in urban and suburban cities are very similar to itself but rural cities are highly varies in fare spend, total driver, and ride occurance.
